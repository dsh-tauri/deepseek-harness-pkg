> **Developer preview.** Upstream changes rapidly and may break compatibility.

## Quick start

These ZIPs contain production npm dependencies for the `dsh` CLI and web UI, not a Node.js binary or a desktop installer. Each `.asar` is the same tree as a single-file Electron resource for Electron apps to mount directly.

**Requirements:** external Node.js `>=22.19.0` on `PATH` (CI uses `22.22.0`); no global pnpm installation is needed to use a ZIP.

Download the matching ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/dsh-tauri/deepseek-harness-pkg/releases), extract it, and open a terminal in the extracted root.

| Platform | ZIP (external Node) | asar (Electron) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows (x64) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows.asar` |
| Windows (ARM64) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows-arm64.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows-arm64.asar` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-arm64.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-arm64.asar` |
| macOS (Intel) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-x64.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-x64.asar` |
| Linux (x64) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-linux.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-linux.asar` |
| Linux (ARM64 / aarch64) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-linux-arm64.zip` | `deepseek-harness-pkg-linux-arm64.asar` |

The asar mirrors the ZIP layout (`node_modules/` + `package.json`) but only Electron's patched `fs` can read it: plain Node needs the ZIP, or `npx @electron/asar extract deepseek-harness-pkg-linux.asar out` first. There is no `unpacked` directory, so executables that must exist on disk — `node-pty`'s `spawn-helper` — also need extracting before they can be spawned.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\node_modules\.bin\dsh.cmd web
```

macOS / Linux:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/dsh web
```

The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:3080`; follow the CLI's authenticated access instructions. Configure a model provider/API key in the UI; see the [upstream docs](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

## Local build

For maintainers: Node.js `>=22.19.0` and pnpm `11.7.0`, as declared in [package.json](<package.json>). The current `@deepseek-ai/dsh` pin is `0.2.1-alpha.1`; the desktop app selects its own compatible core version.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start              # Run dsh web using repository dependencies
pnpm build              # Deploy production dependencies to build_dir/
```

`pnpm build` deploys upstream production dependencies to `build_dir/` without rewriting runtime code; `pnpm start` does not run that deployed output. See the [workspace/build policy](<pnpm-workspace.yaml>) for dependency layout and install-script settings.

## Releases and synchronization

Both sync workflows run every **6 hours** and support manual inputs: optional `version` (empty = automatic selection) and `force` (default `false`) to rebuild.

| Workflow | Input / selection | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [release.yml](<.github/workflows/release.yml>) | Required `dsh_version`: an npm version or `latest`; form default `0.1.2-rc.1` is not the current pin. | Six ZIPs + six asars; regular release `dsh-<version>-<run_id>` (`<version>` uses the input verbatim). |
| [sync-release.yml](<.github/workflows/sync-release.yml>) | Highest semver among all published npm versions, covering all dist-tags, not only `latest`. | Calls the npm release workflow; updates `main`'s manifest and lockfile only after successful publication. |
| [release-from-source.yml](<.github/workflows/release-from-source.yml>) | Required `dsh_version` without `dsh-v`; clones the exact `dsh-v<version>` tag and builds/deploys its runtime closure. | Six ZIPs + six asars; pre-release `dsh-src-<version>-<run_id>`; does not update `main`. |
| [sync-source-release.yml](<.github/workflows/sync-source-release.yml>) | Highest upstream GitHub release version newer than the highest npm version. | Calls the source workflow; skips an existing source pre-release unless forced. |

npm preflight [waits for the actual tarball](<scripts/wait-for-npm-version.mjs>) for up to 10 minutes. It then [installs the complete dependency closure](<scripts/check-dsh-installable.mjs>) with `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` and bounded retries before starting the six-target matrix.

Both release paths [prune the output](<scripts/prune-node-modules.mjs>), pack a same-named asar per platform, and verify twelve uploaded assets. [Size reports](<scripts/check-artifact-size.mjs>) are informational, not release gates. Windows ARM64 is installed natively on `windows-11-arm`; the x64 ZIP name stays `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows.zip`.

## Linux ARM64 compatibility

Both release paths install and build natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (Ubuntu 24.04, glibc 2.39) with Node.js 22.22.0; they do not cross-compile x64 dependencies. After pruning, they check the architecture, load `koffi`, `sharp`, and `node-pty`, and run the deployed CLI's `web --help` on that runner.

**Kylin V10 / glibc 2.28 is not verified or guaranteed.** Locally compiled native modules inherit the runner's toolchain baseline; upstream prebuilt binaries can have their own glibc / libstdc++ requirements. Installing Node.js alone or rebuilding a single module does not establish compatibility for the whole ZIP. Use a newer supported system, or rebuild and test the complete dependency closure (including prebuilt dependencies) on a matching ARM64/glibc 2.28 environment before deployment. These ZIPs still require an external ARM64 Node.js runtime.

## Runtime compatibility

Local builds and both release paths preserve upstream runtime code. The former LAN override and Codex HTML-error patches have been removed so optional customizations do not block packaging when upstream code changes. Host safety checks and provider error formatting now follow the bundled upstream versions. Codex errors may therefore include raw HTML edge-response bodies; treat error logs as potentially sensitive.

For LAN access, consult the bundled CLI's help for its version-specific flags. Recent upstream releases require one concrete local IPv4 or IPv6 address rather than a wildcard such as `0.0.0.0`; the former LAN opt-in environment variable no longer overrides that policy.

`--trusted-host` limits host trust, not authentication. Keep upstream access credentials private and enable LAN access only on trusted networks.

## Security and use

- For personal learning, research, and testing only; please do not use commercially.
- `dsh` can execute local code: use a trusted, isolated environment and avoid untrusted configurations or plugins.
- LAN exposure increases risk; never expose the service to untrusted networks or share access tokens.
- Developers are not liable for data loss or security issues arising from use.
