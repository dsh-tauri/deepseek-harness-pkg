> **Status: developer preview.** The upstream `dsh` is still iterating rapidly with compatibility-breaking changes; this repository tracks it closely and rebuilds automatically.

## What Is This?

[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness with a CLI, a web UI, and a plugin architecture. Setting it up normally means installing Node.js and pnpm and building from source.

This repository (inspired by [n8n-pkg](https://github.com/hairyf/n8n-pkg)) removes that friction: it pins an upstream npm release, patches the dependency closure, and publishes ready-to-run `node_modules` bundles for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), and Linux. Consumers just download a zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/dsh-tauri/deepseek-harness-pkg/releases) page, unzip, and run `dsh web`.

## Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Pinned & reproducible** | A pnpm workspace pins a single upstream version (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`), with a committed lockfile. |
| **Patched dependency closure** | A build-time script applies a LAN-access switch to `dsh web` inside the dependency closure. |
| **Cross-platform artifacts** | CI builds bundles for Windows, macOS (arm64 + x64), and Linux and publishes them as GitHub Releases. |
| **Auto-sync with upstream** | A scheduled workflow watches npm for new `dsh` versions and triggers a rebuild automatically. |
| **Self-contained output** | Each artifact is a plain npm project — unzip, run the `dsh` binary inside `node_modules`, done. |

## Quick Start

1. Download the artifact for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/dsh-tauri/deepseek-harness-pkg/releases) page.
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Run:

```sh
# Windows
node_modules\.bin\dsh.cmd web

# macOS / Linux
./node_modules/.bin/dsh web
```

The web UI opens at `http://127.0.0.1:3080`. On first use, configure a model provider (API key) in the UI — see the [official DeepSeek Harness docs](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

> Requirements: Node.js `>=22.19.0` (CI builds use 22.22.0). The artifact is a plain npm project, so no global pnpm installation is needed.

## Local Build

Requirements: Node.js `>=22.19` (recommended 24), pnpm `11.x` (the repo declares `packageManager: pnpm@11.7.0`).

```sh
pnpm install            # install dependencies
pnpm start              # run dsh web directly (http://127.0.0.1:3080)
pnpm build              # produce the prod deployment directory build_dir/
```

## Release

Open the repository's Actions page and manually trigger **Build and Release DeepSeek Harness**:

- `dsh_version` (required): the dsh version to package. The Actions form pre-fills the literal default declared in `release.yml`; `package.json` pins the version this repository currently tracks. Use `latest` or another explicit version when needed.

The build creates a GitHub Release named `dsh-<version>-<run_id>` with four platform zips:

| Platform | Artifact |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `deepseek-harness-pkg-windows.zip` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-arm64.zip` |
| macOS (Intel) | `deepseek-harness-pkg-macos-x64.zip` |
| Linux | `deepseek-harness-pkg-linux.zip` |

## Patches

### dsh-web-app: LAN access (default off)

Upstream `dsh web` rejects `--host 0.0.0.0` for security reasons (it would expose the remote-code-execution surface to the network). A build-time patch script (`scripts/apply-dsh-web-app-patch.mjs`) turns this into an **explicit environment-variable switch**:

```sh
# still rejected by default
dsh web --host 0.0.0.0            # error

# allow explicitly after acknowledging the risk (dangerous: exposes local RCE to the network)
DSH_PKG_ALLOW_LAN=1 dsh web --host 0.0.0.0 --trusted-host <LAN-IP>:3080
```

> ⚠️ Security warning: `--host 0.0.0.0` lets any device on your LAN access your sessions and tool execution. Use it only in trusted networks and pair it with `--trusted-host` to restrict the `/api` trust domain.

### How the LAN switch is applied

`scripts/apply-dsh-web-app-patch.mjs` is applied idempotently during packaging (see the "Apply dsh-web-app patch" step in `release.yml` / `release-from-source.yml`): it only needs the upstream guard line to exist, and fails loudly with a message to update the script if upstream changes it. There is no pnpm `patchedDependencies` entry anymore — the previous `patches/dsh-web-app@0.1.0-rc.6.patch` was removed when it went stale.

## Auto-sync Upstream Releases

The repository has two complementary scheduled workflows:

- **npm path — `sync-release.yml`**: checks every 6 hours and can also be triggered manually. It resolves the **semver-highest published version** through `scripts/resolve-latest-dsh-version.mjs`, covering all npm dist-tags (`latest`, `next`, …), then calls `release.yml`. After a successful npm release it updates `main` and the lockfile.
- **GitHub-only path — `sync-source-release.yml`**: checks every 6 hours whether the semver-highest upstream GitHub Release is newer than npm `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. If npm has not published that version yet, it calls `release-from-source.yml`, which clones the exact `dsh-v<version>` tag, runs `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build`, deploys the built workspace closure, and publishes four platform archives as a GitHub **pre-release**. These source pre-releases do not update `main`, because the version is not installable from npm yet.
- **Idempotency**: source releases use `dsh-src-<version>-<run_id>` tags. The source watcher skips a version already released this way, while the npm watcher ignores pre-releases so the two paths do not trigger each other repeatedly.
- **Publication propagation**: a freshly published version can show up in the npm packument before its tarball is downloadable, which makes `pnpm add` fail with `ERR_PNPM_FETCH_404`. `release.yml` therefore runs a `preflight` job first — `scripts/wait-for-npm-version.mjs` polls the tarball URL (up to 10 minutes) and only then fans out to the four platform builds.
- **Patch tolerance**: `scripts/apply-dsh-web-app-patch.mjs` idempotently re-applies the LAN switch to the shipped `dsh-web-app`; if upstream changes the relevant guard, it fails loudly with a message to update the script.

For a manual source build, trigger **Build and Pre-release DeepSeek Harness from Source** and provide the upstream release version, without the `dsh-v` prefix (for example `0.1.2-alpha.1`).

## Security Notes

- This project is for personal learning, research, and testing only — please do not use it commercially.
- `dsh` is an agent harness with **local code execution capability**. Run it only in a trusted, isolated environment, and never import untrusted configurations or plugins from unknown sources.
- The LAN-access patch (`DSH_PKG_ALLOW_LAN=1`) is dangerous by design — only enable it on trusted networks.
- The developers are not liable for any data loss or security issues arising from the use of this project.
